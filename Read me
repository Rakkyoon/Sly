To Brennan

It's me, Matt.

It's been almost 2 years since we last spoke, and a lot has changed. I graduated high school, had a panic attack at Marist, left, and finished my first year of college locally. 
But one thing that hasn't changed is that I can't stop worrying about you / missing you. 

I'm gonna come clean and say I've had your stream page bookmarked ever since then, in case I ever felt the time was right to try and reach out again. Because I miss you. 

You were the one person I was sure I could DM when I woke up in the morning and talk to about whatever. I could hop into a game with you and have the time of my life with no 
drawbacks. You were my best friend, and you just disappeared.

I'm sure you had your reasons, and I'm sure you're doing just fine. You're not weak. It's just that I myself haven't been getting along so great.

Literally had a dream where you messaged me back and everything went back to normal... stupid I know, but it messed me up. Enough to write this for you.

My intentions aren't to guilt trip you, but to be brutally honest about my intentions. I wanna be your friend again, Brennan. I wanna be there for you, I want you to be there 
for me. I'm sorry if this is a bit much, but I dunno, maybe this is like some sort of therapy for me. I need to get my thoughts out, and I need you to hear them.

TL;DR: It's Matt, I miss you, I wanna be friends again, I wanna know what happened, I'm sorry if I did anything wrong to you, you're my best friend.

I hope you're doing okay.

Love, Matt
